## Telegraph

Telegraph is a simple Mac application that generates Morse code from text. I wrote it for fun, and to use during a presentation on Morse code. It includes the ability to adjust the speed, and pitch of sent code, as well as an option to use Farnsworth mode for slower code.

I'm releasing this in case anyone else finds it interesting.

Disclaimer: This was a fun side project that I wrote 5 years ago. It shouldn't be taken as an example of my best code.
